Problem Description

You are given a list of canonical strings, for example the SKU name of products, where each canonical string is a unique identifier for an entity. These canonical strings are prone to errors during data entry or they may come from different sites when crawling and may have minor variations. Your task is to write a Python function that matches two canonical strings if they are close enough in meaning despite these variations.


Breakdown

What are canonical strings? 
* In this case, the canonical strings are the series of strings that make up the name of a product. Our problem is that, across the millions of websites on the internet, a singular product's name can  can vary drastically. For a human, we're able to bypass this issue pretty easily because we are able to easily gauge how similar words are. For a computer however, this is a really big issue because they can only find what is explicitly stated.

What is an SKU?
* SKU stands for Stock Keeping Unit
* It acts as a product ID
